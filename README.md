# block-it
A Python script to block websites on Windows. Does so by modifying the hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc. Asks for administrative privileges to append a website's address to the hosts file to block it. Additionally, no code is provided for you to remove the website as to make it difficult for you to unblock the website.

## How to unblock a website
You will need to manually modify the hosts file, as I will not provide a script here for you to do so for your own good. Perhaps in the future additional functionality will be added to handle such a task (e.g. timers, etc.).
